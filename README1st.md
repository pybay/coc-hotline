This is a fork of the PyCon-2018 coc-hotline, as updated by EW Durbin.

For PyBay, we'd like to leverage this to be a geneeral call number for:

- CoC
- Media Team
- Session Staff
- Facilities issues

That may be too ambitious for what is essentially a few days lead time.

I hope to have this good enough to warrant a Pull Request to PyCon.
